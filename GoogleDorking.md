**1. What is Google Dorking?**

Google OSINT/Dorking, mean using Google search to gather intelligence (useful information) from open sources.
Google Dorking (also called **Google Hacking**) is the practice of using **advanced search operators** in Google to uncover information that is not easily visible through standard searches.
It’s not about breaking into systems — it’s about asking Google smarter, more specific questions to dig up things that most people never see.
