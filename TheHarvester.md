The Harvester
TheHarvester is an open-source reconnaissance tool commonly used in OSINT and cybersecurity to collect publicly available information about a target domain. It gathers:
Subdomains
Email addresses
IP addresses
Hostnames
Virtual hosts
Open ports & banners
Employee names
It pulls data from multiple sourcesâ€”including search engines, PGP key servers, threat feeds, and IoT indexesâ€”while operating in a passive, stealthy manner

## **Best Practices for Mastery**

* Always combine **multiple sources** (`-b all`) for broader coverage.
* Use **`-f`** to export results for later analysis.
* Start with **passive collection** (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) before moving to semi-active sources (Shodan).
* Rotate queries and use proxies if your IP gets rate-limited.
* Validate all results manually before drawing conclusions.

### ðŸ“Œ **Notes on Advanced Flags**

* **`--takeover`** â†’ This is particularly important for cybersecurity OSINT, as it detects whether an unused subdomain points to a third-party service that could be hijacked.
* **`--screenshot`** â†’ Useful for visual OSINT reports; takes a snapshot of the targetâ€™s homepage or subdomains.
* **`--dns-tld`** â†’ Helps find domains in multiple TLD variations (e.g., `.com`, `.net`, `.org`).
* **`-g` (Google Dork mode)** â†’ Combines dorks like `site:example.com` automatically for richer recon.
* **`-m`** â†’ Good for avoiding rate limits, especially with aggressive data sources like Google or Bing.

Alright â€” Iâ€™ll walk you through **all the advanced & less-known TheHarvester commands** I just listed, explaining them like a teacher would in class, so you not only *know what they do* but also *when and why to use them* in OSINT investigations.

---

## ðŸ“– **TheHarvester â€“ Advanced Commands Explained**

---

### **1. `-t` (Custom Wordlist for DNS Brute Force)**

* **What it does:**
  When you brute-force subdomains (`-c` or `--dns-brute`), TheHarvester uses a default wordlist.
  `-t` lets you **specify your own list** of potential subdomains.
* **Why it matters:**
  Your investigation may be more effective if you have industry-specific subdomain names (e.g., `vpn`, `intranet`, `mail`).
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b bing -c -t subdomains.txt
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  A good wordlist can uncover *hidden services* the default list would miss.

---

### **2. `-e` (Exclude Sources)**

* **What it does:**
  Runs against all sources except the ones you name.
* **Why it matters:**
  Some sources return too much irrelevant data or require an API you donâ€™t have.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b all -e shodan,yahoo
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  Speeds up scans when avoiding noisy or redundant data feeds.

---

### **3. `-g` (Google Dork Mode)**

* **What it does:**
  Automatically uses crafted Google search operators for recon.
* **Why it matters:**
  This applies **Google Dorking** principles directly from within TheHarvester.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b google -g
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  Great for finding exposed documents, config files, or login pages.

---

### **4. `-r` (Reverse IP Lookup via Bing)**

* **What it does:**
  Finds other domains hosted on the same IP.
* **Why it matters:**
  May reveal **affiliated sites** or poorly secured subdomains.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b bing -r
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  Useful for mapping an organizationâ€™s *entire* online footprint.

---

### **5. `-m` (Delay Between Requests)**

* **What it does:**
  Adds a pause (in seconds) between queries to avoid rate-limiting or IP bans.
* **Why it matters:**
  Crucial when querying Google, Bing, or APIs with strict limits.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b google -m 5
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  For very large scans, always set a delay.

---

### **6. `--dns-lookup`**

* **What it does:**
  Resolves discovered hostnames to IP addresses.
* **Why it matters:**
  Links virtual names to real infrastructure.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b google --dns-lookup
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  Helpful for identifying hosting providers or geographic server locations.

---

### **7. `--dns-tld`**

* **What it does:**
  Enumerates the same domain name across different TLDs.
* **Why it matters:**
  Organizations sometimes register multiple variations (`example.com`, `example.org`).
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example -b google --dns-tld tlds.txt
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  Good for finding *look-alike domains* used in phishing.

---

### **8. `--dns-resolver`**

* **What it does:**
  Uses a specific DNS resolver (e.g., Googleâ€™s `8.8.8.8`).
* **Why it matters:**
  Helps avoid DNS poisoning and speeds up lookups.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b bing --dns-resolver 8.8.8.8
  ```

---

### **9. `--vhost`**

* **What it does:**
  Checks for virtual hosts running on the same IP.
* **Why it matters:**
  Identifies **multiple websites** on a single server.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b all --vhost
  ```

---

### **10. `--takeover`**

* **What it does:**
  Checks for subdomains that could be hijacked (DNS points to unused service).
* **Why it matters:**
  Critical for security assessments and bug bounties.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b all --takeover
  ```
* **OSINT Tip:**
  Use only on domains you own or have permission to test.

---

### **11. `--shodan-api`**

* **What it does:**
  Sets your Shodan API key for IoT & exposed service scanning.
* **Why it matters:**
  Enables deeper recon by revealing open ports, banners, and device types.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b shodan --shodan-api <API_KEY>
  ```

---

### **12. `--source-list`**

* **What it does:**
  Displays all available data sources.
* **Why it matters:**
  Lets you explore lesser-known OSINT feeds supported by TheHarvester.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester --source-list
  ```

---

### **13. `--screenshot`**

* **What it does:**
  Takes screenshots of discovered hosts.
* **Why it matters:**
  Adds visual evidence for OSINT reports.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b all --screenshot
  ```

---

### **14. `--company`**

* **What it does:**
  Uses a company name instead of a domain (mainly for LinkedIn searches).
* **Why it matters:**
  Targets people and profiles instead of infrastructure.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester --company "Tesla Inc" -b linkedin
  ```

---

### **15. `--timeout`**

* **What it does:**
  Sets a maximum wait time (seconds) for HTTP requests.
* **Why it matters:**
  Avoids hanging if a source is slow.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  theharvester -d example.com -b all --timeout 10
  ```
